    "> • Do a Simple Linear Regression (one independent variable)  \n",
    "> • Do a Multivariate Linear Regression (multiple independent variables)   \n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in lecture, planners can use regressions in a multitude of ways, from diagnosing a problem or bringing it to light, to determining at what level to intervene, to assessing the impact of an intervention. The kind of regression you will run depends on what phenomenon you want to understand (your dependent variable) and what factor(s) you hypothesize may be associated with it (your independent variables; explanatory or control variables).

Remember the equation for a linear regression with one explanatory variable is:\n",
